# 6. Caching einbauen

## Getestet wurde mit:

*   Ruby-1.9.3-p429 
*   Thin 1.5.1 (neu)
*   Production Mode
*   MySql
*	Caching

## Requests pro Sekunde:

*	front page:		   99,55 [#/sec]
*	user page:		~ 101,05 [#/sec] (3 Messungen)
*	recipes page:	~ 107,79 [#/sec] (3 Messungen)

## Ergebnis:

*	Improved front page requests per second by 43182,6%.
*	Improved user page requests per second by 29105,2%.
*	Improved recipe page requests per second by 5615,3%.

## NÃ¤chster Schritt:

*	schnell genug ;)
