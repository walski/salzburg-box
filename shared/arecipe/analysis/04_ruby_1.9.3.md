# 4. Ruby auf 1.9.3 updaten

## Getestet wurde mit:

*   Ruby-1.9.3-p429 (neu)
*   Webrick 1.3.1
*   Production Mode
*   MySql

## Requests pro Sekunde:

*	front page:		  7,51 [#/sec]
*	user page:		~ 9,46 [#/sec] (3 Messungen)
*	recipes page:	~ 39,62 [#/sec] (3 Messungen)

## Ergebnis:

*	Improved front page requests per second by 3029,2%.
*	Improved user page requests per second by 2634,1%.
*	Improved recipe page requests per second by 2000,1%.

## NÃ¤chster Schritt:

*	Webrick durch Thin austauschen um Requests asynchron zu verarbeiten.
