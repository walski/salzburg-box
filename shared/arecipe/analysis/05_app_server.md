# 5. Webrick durch Thin ersetzen

## Getestet wurde mit:

*   Ruby-1.9.3-p429 
*   Thin 1.5.1 (neu)
*   Production Mode
*   MySql

## Requests pro Sekunde:

*	front page:		  7,73 [#/sec]
*	user page:		~ 10,02 [#/sec] (3 Messungen)
*	recipes page:	~ 47,74 [#/sec] (3 Messungen)

## Ergebnis:

*	Improved front page requests per second by 3260,9%.
*	Improved user page requests per second by 2796,0%.
*	Improved recipe page requests per second by 2431,3%.

## NÃ¤chster Schritt:

*	Caching einbauen um Datenbankabfragen zu minimieren.
